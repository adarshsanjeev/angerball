# Controls

The controls for the game are the same as the ones given in the pdf.
Mouse or keyboard can be used.

# Text

Due to some errors, the text is not displayed. The sample code given did not run, with the error
'Could not find arial.tff'
despite it being present. A post was made on moodle, but didn't get any solution, so as a workaround,
the function createSevenSeg() has been taken. The only function of this is to print the score and
birds left.
